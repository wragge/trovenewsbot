trovenewsbot
============

See me in action at [@TroveNewsBot](http://twitter.com/trovenewsbot).

Built using the [Trove API](http://trove.nla.gov.au/general/api).

Basic bot interactions:

* Include the word 'hello' in a message to @TroveNewsBot to receive a greeting and a random newspaper article.
* Any other message will be treated as a query and will be sent off to the Trove API to look for matching results in the newspaper database.
* By default, the TroveNewsBot returns the first (ie most relevant) matching result. To retrieve a random article from the matching results include the hashtag #luckydip.
* If you just want any old random article just send TroveNewsBot the hashtag #luckydip and nothing else.
* Include a year to limit your search to that year.

Automatic botness:

* At 9am, 3pm and 9pm (AEST), TroveNewsBot tweets a random article that has been updated or added in the previous 24 hours.
